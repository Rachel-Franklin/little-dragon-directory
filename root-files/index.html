                        <h3>Resin vs. Rosin</h3>
                        <p>The biggest distinction between resin and rosin is the extraction process by which they are made. Live resin is extracted using chemical solvents like ethanol and carbon dioxide, whereas rosin is solventless. The resin extraction process is more difficult than that of rosin, so it is generally more expensive, but the final product typically contains more THC potency</p>

                        <h3>What is Dabbing?</h3>
                        <p>Dabbing involves the use of a dab rig to vaporize marijuana concentrates like shatter, wax, crumble, etc. to smokable form. A titanium (or quartz or ceramic) nail is heated using a torch, then the user places a small amount of concentrate onto the heated nail, inhaling the generated vapor through the mouthpiece of the rig</p>

                        <h3>What are Terpenes?</h3>
                        <p>Terpenes are naturally occurring compounds found in plants. They are responsible for the aromas, flavors, and even colors associated with various types of vegetation. As they relate to the cannabis plant, terpenes give unique strains their specific smell and/or taste. A strain's terpene profile is what distinguishes it from other strains, both in terms of aroma &amp; flavor, as well as the experienced effects</p>
